### Your challenge, if you choose to accept it...
Your task is to write a command line ruby app that does the following:
* Given two numbers i.e. 1 & 100, work out which of the numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive) are palindromes.
    * ```palindrome (noun) - a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. 1, 101, 1001, 1221, etc.```
* Load the two numbers from a file where:
    * The first line is the 'from' number
    * The second number is the 'to' number
* Output a nice message for each of the files like this:
```bash
File checked: test_files/example.txt
Range: 1..100
Palindromes: 18
================
```
* The below command line statement should run through all of the files as per the above
```bash
ruby counter.rb
```
* You should show your workings on GitHub
* You should not spend more than 2 hours on this test
